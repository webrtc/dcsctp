# dcSCTP

An [SCTP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9260) implementation for
[WebRTC Data Channels](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8831).

## Purpose

This implementation of dcSCTP can be seen as a spiritual successor to the
[C++ version](https://webrtc.googlesource.com/src/+/refs/heads/main/net/dcsctp)
developed for the WebRTC project by the same authors. It retains the core
concepts while leveraging Rust's security features and improved ergonomics.
